# BCLL Draft (React + Vite + Tailwind)

Zero-console deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `BCLL_Draft`).
2. Upload all files in this folder via **Add files → Upload files** (drag-and-drop).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**, set **Source: GitHub Actions**.
4. Wait for the workflow (Actions tab) to finish.
5. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/BCLL_Draft/`.

> If your repo name differs, edit `vite.config.ts` → change `base: '/BCLL_Draft/'` to match `/<YourRepoName>/`.
